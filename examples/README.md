# Examples

These are sample outputs showing what AIAgentMinder's state files look like in practice, mid-way through a real project. They are **not templates to copy** — the actual templates live in `project/`.

The fictional project is a REST API for a recipe sharing app (Node.js / Express / PostgreSQL), built by a solo developer targeting the Standard quality tier. It's mid-Phase 1: the project scaffold exists, auth is partially working, and the first few endpoints are in place.

See [demo-transcript.md](demo-transcript.md) for a walkthrough of three sessions using these files.
