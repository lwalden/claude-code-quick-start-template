![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-5.0-blue)

A governance and lifecycle framework for AI coding agents. Adds persistent session memory, architectural decision tracking, and structured planning to help you take a project from idea to MVP and beyond.

Works with **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Cursor**, and any agent that reads `AGENTS.md`.

> **What this is:** A set of markdown files, slash commands, and governance hooks that shape how AI agents work with your code. Not a CLI tool, not an MCP server, not a code generator.

## Why Use This

AI coding agents are powerful, but multi-session projects need structure:

| Problem | AIAgentMinder Solution |
|---|---|
| Agent forgets what happened last session | **PROGRESS.md** -- git-tracked audit trail read first every session |
| Agent re-debates past decisions | **DECISIONS.md** -- ADR log with trigger criteria prevents re-debating |
| Projects start without clear goals | **Plan mode** -- structured interview that produces a strategy roadmap with quality tiers |
| Sessions end with loose ends | **Session cleanup** -- updates PROGRESS.md at session end so the next session resumes with a single prompt |
| Dangerous commands slip through | **Safe defaults** -- minimal permissions baseline with explicit deny list (Claude Code); Copilot org policies supported |
| Context lost between sessions | **Session continuity** -- project state is re-injected at session start so the agent is oriented without re-prompting |

---

## Multi-Agent Support

The same project works with any agent. Each agent reads its own config file; all agents share the same `PROGRESS.md` and `DECISIONS./md` state.

| Feature | Claude Code | Copilot (VS Code) | Codex | Cursor |
|---------|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Session protocol | Full (native) | Full (hooks) | Manual | Manual |
| PROGRESS.md tracking | Full | Full (hooks) | Manual | Manual |
| DECISIONS.md | Full | Full (hooks) | Manual | Manual |
| `/plan` command | Yes | — | — | — |
| `/checkpoint` command | Yes | — | — | — |
| Auto-commit on session end | Yes | Yes | — | — |
| Context re-injection | Yes | Yes | N/A | N/A |
| Auto-lint on edit | Yes | Yes | — | — |
| Permissions system | Full | Org policies | Limited | — |

**Switching agents between sessions:** No file changes needed. End the session cleanly (update PROGRESS.md, commit), then open with a different agent. State lives in git.

See [project/docs/agent-setup.md](project/docs/agent-setup.md) for per-agent configuration details.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lwalden/claude-code-quick-start-template.git
cd claude-code-quick-start-template
```

### 2. Set up your project

**Claude Code:** Open Claude Code in the cloned directory and run `/setup`. It will ask about your project and copy the framework files to your target location:

- **New GitHub repo** -- creates the repo and sets up all files
- **Existing repo** -- copies files with confirmation prompts
- **New local project** -- creates directory, `git init`, sets up files
- **Current directory** -- fits template into existing structure

**Other agents:** Open your agent in the cloned directory and say:
`"Read SETUP.md and follow the instructions"`
It will ask about your project and copy the framework files to your target location.

### 3. Create your strategy roadmap

**Claude Code:** Open Claude Code in your target project and run `/plan`. Claude interviews you about your idea and generates `docs/strategy-roadmap.md`.

**Other agents:** Open your agent in the target project and say:
`"Read PLAN.md and follow the instructions"`
Your agent will interview you about your idea and generate `docs/strategy-roadmap.md`.

### 4. Start building

```
Claude Code: "Read CLAUDE.md and PROGRESS.md, then start Phase 1."
Other agents: "Read AGENTS.md and PROGRESS.md, then start Phase 1."
```

**Manual setup alternative:** Copy `project/*` to your repo, then customize for your agent:
- **All agents:** Fill in the Project Identity placeholders in `AGENTS.md`
- **Claude Code:** `CLAUDE.md` is already set (it just imports `AGENTS.md` — no changes needed unless you want to add Claude-specific notes); also customize `.claude/settings.json` with your stack permissions
- **Copilot:** Also fill in the Project Identity placeholders in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to match; enable hooks with `"github.copilot.chat.agent.runHooks": true` in VS Code settings
- **Codex / Cursor:** `AGENTS.md` alone is sufficient — no additional config files required

## What You Get

| File | Purpose | Who reads it |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `AGENTS.md` (~80 lines) | Session protocol, project identity, behavioral rules | Codex, Cursor, all AGENTS.md agents |
| `CLAUDE.md` (~15 lines) | Thin wrapper: imports AGENTS.md + Claude hook info | Claude Code (auto, every session) |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Full instructions for Copilot | GitHub Copilot (auto) |
| `PROGRESS.md` (~20 lines) | Current tasks, blockers, priorities | All agents (every session, first thing) |
| `DECISIONS.md` | Architectural decision log | All agents (before architectural choices) |
| `docs/strategy-roadmap.md` | Goals, architecture, timeline, quality tier | All agents (on-demand) |
| `docs/agent-setup.md` | Per-agent setup reference | Human reference |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code permissions + hook config | Claude Code (config) |
| `.claude/commands/` | `/plan`, `/checkpoint` | Claude Code (on use) |
| `.claude/hooks/` | 4 Node.js governance hooks | Claude Code (automatic) |
| `.github/hooks/` | 3 Copilot governance hooks | GitHub Copilot (automatic) |

### Governance Hooks

Four Node.js scripts handle session automation. They run automatically for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot; for other agents the same outcomes are achieved manually by following the session protocol in `AGENTS.md`.

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does | Claude Code | Copilot | Codex / Cursor |
|------|---------|-------------|:-----------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
| Timestamp | Session end | Updates "Last Updated" in PROGRESS.md | Auto | Auto | Manual |
| Auto-commit | Session end | Git checkpoint on feature branches (tracked files only) | Auto | Auto | Manual |
| Context reload | Session start | Re-injects PROGRESS.md and DECISIONS.md after context reset | Auto | Auto | N/A |
| Auto-format | After file edit | Runs project formatters (prettier, black, rustfmt, etc.) | Auto | Auto | Manual |

### Permissions (Claude Code / GitHub Copiot only)

Claude Code:
Starts with ~20 safe commands (git, gh, basic utilities). Stack-specific tools added during `/setup`. Dangerous operations are explicitly denied:
- `rm -rf /`, `~`, `C:`, `.` -- catastrophic deletion
- `git push --force` / `-f` -- history rewriting
- `git reset --hard origin` -- destructive reset
- `git clean -fd`, `chmod -R 777` -- unsafe operations

GitHub Copilot:
For GitHub Copilot, equivalent safety controls are available via Copilot org-level policies and the `preToolUse` hook in `.github/hooks/`.

## Commands

| Action | Claude Code | Other agents |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Initialize a project | `/setup` | `"Read SETUP.md and follow the instructions"` |
| Create strategy roadmap | `/plan` | `"Read PLAN.md and follow the instructions"` |
| End-of-session cleanup | `/checkpoint` | `"Update PROGRESS.md and DECISIONS.md, then commit"` |
| Resume next session | `"Read CLAUDE.md and PROGRESS.md, then resume"` | `"Read AGENTS.md and PROGRESS.md, then resume"` |

---

## How It Works

**Session continuity:** The agent reads PROGRESS.md at session start. At session end, `/checkpoint` (or the auto-commit hook) preserves state. Between sessions, progress lives in Git -- any agent can pick up where another left off.

**Session resilience:** For Claude Code and GitHub Copilot, governance hooks fire on session end regardless of how the session terminates -- including abrupt endings from rate limits, subscription cutoffs, or crashes. PROGRESS.md is timestamped and staged work is committed automatically before the session closes. For Codex and Cursor (no hook system), an abrupt session end leaves no automatic record: uncommitted changes are untracked and PROGRESS.md is not updated. If you use those agents on active work, committing frequently and running session cleanup manually reduces the risk of losing context.

**Context budget:** Files are sized for minimal token consumption. For Claude Code: CLAUDE.md (~15 lines) imports AGENTS.md (~80 lines) = ~95 lines per session. PROGRESS.md (~20 lines) is read first every session. Larger files are on-demand. PROGRESS.md self-trims: only the 3 most recent session notes are kept.

**Decision tracking:** DECISIONS.md prevents re-debating. The agent checks it before architectural choices. Trigger criteria: library/framework choice, API design, auth approach, data model change, build/deploy decision.

## Troubleshooting

- **Commands not showing (VS Code)** -- Close/reopen the Claude Code panel
- **Agent keeps asking permission** -- Add the command to `.claude/settings.json` allow list (Claude Code)
- **Agent lost track** -- `git status`, `git log --oneline -5`, update PROGRESS.md
- **Agent re-debates decisions** -- Add to DECISIONS.md with rationale
- **Copilot not reading instructions** -- Check that `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists; verify Copilot custom instructions are enabled in VS Code settings
- **Hooks not running (Copilot)** -- Enable `"github.copilot.chat.agent.runHooks": true` in VS Code settings and ensure Node.js is installed
