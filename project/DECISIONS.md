# DECISIONS.md - Architectural Decision Record

> Track significant decisions to avoid re-debating across sessions.
> When ADRs are superseded, move old ones to `docs/archive/decisions-archive.md`.

## When to Create an ADR

Add an entry here when a significant decision is made:
- Technology or framework choices
- Database schema design decisions
- API design patterns
- Authentication/authorization approaches
- Deployment strategies
- Third-party service selections

Not every small implementation choice needs an ADR -- use judgment.
