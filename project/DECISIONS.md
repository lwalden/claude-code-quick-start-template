# DECISIONS.md - Architectural Decision Log

> Record significant decisions to prevent re-debating them later.
> Claude reads this before making architectural choices.

Add entries as decisions are made. Keep them short -- the goal is to capture *what was decided and why*, not to write essays.

**Format:**
```
### [Short decision title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Status:** Active | **Chose:** [what was chosen]
**Why:** [1-2 sentence rationale. What alternatives were rejected and why?]
```

**Status values:** Active | Superseded | Revisit
